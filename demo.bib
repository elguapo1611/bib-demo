abstract = {Computing as you know it is about to change, your applications and documents are going to move from the desktop into the cloud. I'm talking about cloud computing, where applications and files are hosted on a "cloud" consisting of thousands of computers and servers, all linked together and accessible via the Internet. With cloud computing, everything you do is now web based instead of being desktop based. You can access all your programs and documents from any computer that's connected to the Internet. How will cloud computing change the way you work? For one thing, you're no longer tied to a single computer. You can take your work anywhere because it's always accessible via the web. In addition, cloud computing facilitates group collaboration, as all group members can access the same programs and documents from wherever they happen to be located. Cloud computing might sound far-fetched, but chances are you're already using some cloud applications. If you're using a web-based email program, such as Gmail or Hotmail, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a web-based application such as Google Calendar or Apple Mobile Me, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a file- or photo-sharing site, such as Flickr or Picasa Web Albums, you're computing in the cloud. It's the technology of the future, available to use today.},

In this paper we offer a framework for theorising about mobile learning, to complement theories of infant, classroom, workplace and informal learning. A related aim is to inform the design of new environments and technologies to support mobile learning, since the work described here has been developed through a series of projects to design mobile learning technology. In the tradition of Activity Theory we analyse learning as a cultural-historical activity system, mediated by tools that both constrain and support the learners in their goals of transforming their knowledge and skills. We separate two perspectives, or layers, of tool-mediated activity. The semiotic layer describes learning as a semiotic system in which the learners object- oriented actions are mediated by cultural tools and signs. The technological layer represents learning as an engagement with technology, in which tools such as computers and mobile phones function as interactive agents in the process of coming to know. These layers can be prised apart, to provide either a semiotic framework to promote discussion with educational theorists to analyse learning in the mobile age, or a technological framework for software developers and engineers to propose requirements for the design and evaluation of new mobile learning systems. Or the layers can be superimposed to examine the dynamics and co-evolution of learning and technology.},

With the introduction of mobile agent into the pervasive mobile devices, the application model enables all corresponding IP messages to go through the mobile agent, which can directly detect the status information of the IP messages, thus making it possible to switch the mobile devices smoothly. Through handoff delay analysis and simulation experiments, the paper also analyses and contrasts the performance of the pervasive mobile devices before and after the mobile agent is introduced. The results show that with the introduction of mobile agent, the pervasive mobile devices can switch smoothly and swiftly, decrease handoff delay and the status information in the process of the transmission and reduce the loss ratio of handoff of the mobile devices, thus effectively improving the performance of the mobile networks in the pervasive computing environment.},

In this project, a mobile agent is created for every request made by the user. The mobile agent departs from the mobile host and then searches for the information appropriate to the user's requirements. After the job is completed, they bring the results to the mobile host. Since the mobile agents do not need continuous communication with the mobile host, they are not affected by the sudden disconnection of wireless network and the situation of turning mobile host off for power saving. A critical problem can arise if the mobile host is disconnected while the mobile agent wants to return the result from the user's request to mobile host.
